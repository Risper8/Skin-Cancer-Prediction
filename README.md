# Skin Cancer Prediction

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with code for predicting skin cancer types and determining their severity (malignant vs. benign).

## Datasets

The models are trained using the following datasets from Kaggle:

- [Multiple Skin Disease Detection and Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pritpal2873/multiple-skin-disease-detection-and-classification)
- [Skin Cancer Malignant vs. Benign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign)

## Methodology

The models were developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-Learn

## Results

- **Type of Cancer Prediction Model:** 85% accuracy
- **Severity Prediction (Malignant vs. Benign):** 87% accuracy
